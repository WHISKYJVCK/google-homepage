The repository was created in the early stages of the self-taught development training. By the end of this project, I hope to be able to demonstrate the following.
- two ways to move a div around on the page
- stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
- identify the background color of an existing webpage
- grab the URL for an image from and existing webpage
- center an element horizontally
- identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
- understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
- build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere)
